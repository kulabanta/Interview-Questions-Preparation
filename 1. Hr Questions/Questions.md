# Common Hr questions
## 1️⃣ Self Introduction
My name is Kulabanta, and I have around 3 years of experience as a Software Engineer, primarily working as a full-stack developer.

I currently work with .NET Core and Angular, where I design and develop REST APIs, work on business logic, and integrate frontend components with backend services. I’ve been involved in building and maintaining production-grade applications, focusing on performance, reliability, and clean architecture.

In my current role, I’ve worked on features end-to-end, contributed to system enhancements, and supported testing and deployment activities. I’ve also worked with Azure services, CI/CD pipelines, and follow Agile development practices.

At this stage, I’m looking to take on more challenging backend problems, gain deeper exposure to system design, and contribute to scalable systems, which is why this role strongly interests me.
## 2️⃣ Why do you want to leave your Current Company ?
### Balanced Answer
I’ve learned a lot in my current role and I’m grateful for the opportunities I’ve had. Over the last few years, I’ve gained strong hands-on experience in building and maintaining production systems.

However, at this stage of my career, I’m looking for more challenging problems, greater ownership, and exposure to system design and scalable architecture, which are limited in my current setup.

I feel this is the right time for me to move to an environment where I can grow technically and contribute at a higher level.”
